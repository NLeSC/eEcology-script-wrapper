TODO
----

- query db using priveleges of user logged into webapp
-- Basic authenticaton header contains for username and password
-- Make connection for each user
--- Use username keyed sqlalchemy pool for example https://pypi.python.org/pypi/litex.cxpool/1.0.2
-- use application user to connect to db and in db use views which require username
- have eager tasks aka syncronous tasks
- Use sqlite as broker/resultstore, if works no need for redis server
- make tracker selection (with settings) save-able/load-able by label using browser storage.
