TODO
----

- query db using priveleges of user logged into webapp
-- [x] Basic authenticaton header contains for username and password
-- [x] Make connection for each user for each request
-- webapp and scripts should use *_limited views.
- have eager tasks aka syncronous tasks
- [x] Use sqlite as broker/resultstore, if works no need for redis server
- [x] make tracker selection (with settings) save-able/load-able by label using browser storage.
- use openearth to connect to db
-- ??? Undefined variable "java" or class "java.util.Properties".
